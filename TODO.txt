Should it be a Basic Object?

> DSL for INSIDE modify blocks
> normal blobject.member= is usable outside modify blocks
> usage syntax
>> modify block
> works like hash which always symbolizes keys
>> [], merge
> has_<name>?
> freeze/defrost/frozen

> to_yaml
> to_json
>> Clean on serialize
> save ?format
> load ?format

> recursively blobjectifies when loading yaml/json

class A < Blobject
  [[r]?[allow|prohibit]] :this, :that, :the_other
end
> filtering
> recursive


EXAMPLES
  > to/from yaml
  > JSON response
  > DSL
  > Config
  >>> can make config maintainable by translating it


> benefits: configuration ease
> using hashes with config/json and active record because of key symbolization



EXTRAS:

explore what other hash-like functionality we can duplicate

load_config, monitor for changes

automatically handle json request params into blobjects

does it work with y, j and jj ???
